# Trakpak 3 Developer Resources

Trakpak 3.0 "Beta", Copyright 2019-2020 by Magnum MacKivler

(I'm only calling it Beta because there was technically an Alpha like, a year ago, to test out standard gauge physics.)

Trakpak3 is currently in development. This will be the master list for materials, models, brushwork, and other things needed to develop for trakpak. I'm changing my plan for Trakpak3's release schedule. Instead of releasing everything at once (which will take a great deal of time), I plan to release an initial set of resources, enough to get people (including myself) started on mapping, and the rest will be filled in as time goes by.

### The Day 1 To-Do List:

This is a list of everything I want to release trakpak3 with as soon as possible, to allow people to learn and figure out how things work.

* John Henry, the Expression 2-based Track Generator, which takes care of the bulk of normal track generation.
* A decent set of 56" (Realistic Standard Gauge) tracks, including a few bridges, diamonds, and some other special track.
* A full set of color-light (CL) and position-light (PL) signals, as well as a few poles or gantries for them to use.
* A few miscellaneous models like Crossing Gates and Switch Throws.
* All available road textures for the construction of road brushes/models.
* All the lua required to get trakpak3's signals and switches working.
* Enough documentation in the wiki to actually use the stuff in the list above.

### Updates as we go:

This is a list of everything I plan to make after trakpak3's release, either to support the conversion of Sunset Gulch or my next map, Amber Waves, or because I promised to make them or thought they'd be handy to have.

* More signal styles (CPL, Searchlight, Tri-Light, Semaphore).
* Packs of models for other gauges, including 2' and 3' Narrow Gauges.
* More crossing and switch throw models.
* Random/AI Cars for driving on all those fancy roads and getting stuck at all those fancy crossings - system is also planned to include some automobile models to go with it.
* More stuff will be added as I think of it.

### Community Contribution

A few people have expressed interest in contributing to Trakpak3 development, in either helping me flesh out the American stuff, or in making props for international maps. I am very grateful for the help, and to keep things organized, those contributors will be hand-picked. More information will be available as the V3.0 Release gets closer.
