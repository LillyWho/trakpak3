# Trakpak 3 Developer Resources

Trakpak 3.0 "Beta", Copyright 2019-2020 by Magnum MacKivler

(I'm only calling it Beta because there was technically an Alpha like, a year ago, to test out standard gauge physics.)

Trakpak3 is currently in development. This will be the master list for materials, models, brushwork, and other things needed to develop for trakpak. I'm changing my plan for Trakpak3's release schedule. Instead of releasing everything at once (which will take a great deal of time), I plan to release an initial set of resources, enough to get people (including myself) started on mapping, and the rest will be filled in as time goes by.

**The files uploaded here are incomplete and unfinished. Furthermore, they are not organized in a way that is conducive to testing yet. Downloading trakpak3 at the current stage of development is NOT recommended!**

### Community Contribution

A few people have expressed interest in contributing to Trakpak3 development, in either helping me flesh out the American stuff, or in making props for international maps. I am very grateful for the help, and to keep things organized, those contributors will be hand-picked. More information will be available as the V3.0 Release gets closer.
